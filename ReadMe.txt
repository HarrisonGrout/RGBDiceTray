This project is a personal project to create an RGB dice try to be used for DND or any dice game.
For best visual effect, translucent dice should be used.

Initial design invloved custom PCB and PIC microcontroller but an Arduino Nano will be used as PoC and the PIC circuit will be implemented at a later date.
